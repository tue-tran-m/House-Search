# House-Search
This is a group work for Data Structure and Algorithm class
The main goal of this project is to create a C++ application that sorts houses based on various criteria such as price, number of bedrooms, and price range. The application utilizes a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) database to store and manage house data efficiently. Sorting functionalities are implemented using both Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms to provide users with options for sorting based on different criteria. The application also has a simple user interface implemented using the SFML/Graphics.hpp library, making it easy for users to input sorting preferences and interact with the application.
